<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The openaltimeter is a small, lightweight, low-power logging altimeter with an optional built-in LiPo regulator and a very loud beeper! It's aimed at radio-controlled glider pilots, particularly DLG fliers, but because the firmware is open-source it can be customised completely for other applications.</p>

<h2>DLG features</h2>

<p>The openaltimeter was designed as a low-cost "do everything" piece of electronics for discus-launched gliders (DLG). Feature highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logging altimeter with better than 0.5m height resolution and 4Mbits of onboard memory. Log a full weekend's flying without needing to clear the memory.</li>
<li>At-the-field launch-height readout. Optimise your launches with real-time feedback.</li>
<li>Fully configurable low-voltage alarm with 90dB sounder. Because the firmware is completely customisable new battery types can be added in the future.</li>
<li>Optional on-board LiPo regulation using a high-efficiency Recom 1A switching regulator. Low-voltage alarm works both with and without regulator. The board can also be fitted with an old-fashioned linear regulator chip (untested).</li>
<li>Assembled board, without regulator or leads, is 31mm x 16mm and weighs 3.1g. Current consumption averages 4.5mA when sounder is quiet.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a quick tour of the features and to see the openaltimeter in use, check out the following short video, available in glorious HD!</p>

<h2>Open-source firmware</h2>
<p>The thing that really makes the openaltimeter different though is that the <a href="firmware.html">firmware code</a> is freely available under an <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">open-source licence</a>. The board has been designed to be compatible with the easy-to-use, free <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> programming system, which means even absolute beginners can be hacking their own custom builds of the firmware within minutes. No specialist programmers or expensive software licences needed: the same connecting cable that's used to download the data from the logger is used to re-program the board.</p>

<p>Don't like the way it beeps at you? Want a custom startup tune? Want it to play "The Flight of the Valkyries" when you throw a switch on your transmitter? Want to log the battery voltage a hundred times per second to detect voltage glitches? Want to turn it in to a height-limiting switch for eSoaring? Want to interface it to other sensors that have a serial output (e.g. GPS) and log those? Want to connect it to your Jeti telemetry system? All possible with a bit of coding! You might say the sky's the limit (groan). If you're interested in hacking the firmware then you should check out the <a href="hardware.html">hardware</a> page to get an idea of what's possible. The <a href="firmware.html">firmware</a> page describes how the firmware is built, and has instructions on how to start hacking.
